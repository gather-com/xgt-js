# XGT JS Client Library

## Scripts

* `yarn build` or `npm run build` - produces production version of your library under the `lib` folder
* `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` - produces development version of your library and runs a watcher
* `yarn test` or `npm run test` - well ... it runs the tests :)
* `yarn test:watch` or `npm run test:watch` - same as above but in a watch mode
